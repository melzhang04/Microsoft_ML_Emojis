# Microsoft_ML_Emojis
To create a LLM to analyze text and generate a representative emoji

This branch is dedicated towards the month of October and our focus which is "Modeling and Evaluation"

"Tokenizer and Model Saved Configs" folder contains tokenizer and "bert-base-uncased" model saved weights configurations set during Demo 1: Finetuning Approach Using Google Bert. 

"Data" folder contains keywords csv file loaded into the program, keywords and their corresponding emojis text file, and "cnn_dailynews".py our dataset used for training the model which is a loading script downloaded from hugginface. 

Towards the end of Demo 1, 10 random text samples generated from ChatGPT were used to gauge the performance of our models inferences on new unseen data.
